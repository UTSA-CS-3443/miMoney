				Standards for storing data in files
				
	In order for our application to run smoother and for the FileParser classes to execute faster, 
	please have a toString() method in each class, whose data will need to be stored.
	For example: 
	
	public class Expense
	{
	
		private double amount;			// The amount of the Expense
	
		private Date transactionDate;	// The Date the Expense was made
	
		private String item;			// description of the item bought
		
		
		//constructor
		public class Expense();
		
		//toString method to use to store the data in file
		public String toString()
		{
		return (String.format("%s:%f:%s:%s", this.getClassName(),this.getAmmount(), 
				this.getDate().toString(), this.getItem()));
		}
	}
	
	Notice that double values are stored as is and are not formatted in any way;
	using a .2f% or .10%f format specifier is not okay in this instance.
	
	Also notice that the Date object stored in the Expense has a toString() method
	that returns the the string representation of the object as it should be represented
	in the expense.
